        <p class="">
            For a 2nd year course, there was a half-semester long project at a company by choice. 
            My group did this at Turff. 
            The task was to make a advertisement scheduling interface through a webapp.
            <br><br>
            I learned a lot about working in a software team. 
            Parts like using git and pipelines, As well as testing code. 
            Another important part was communicating with a 
            client and making sure their wishes are being met.
            <br><br>
            On the coding side i learned working with nuxt and nextJS to build webapps. 
            Furthermore I learned making a login system with JWT. As well as optimizing SQL queries.
